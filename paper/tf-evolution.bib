                   hit. Using genomes from the genus Saccharomyces, we
                   illustrate how the significance of real sites increases
                   with evolutionary distance and explore the relationship
                   between conservation and function.},

                   technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of
                   global expression profiles of messenger RNA have
                   greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal
                   state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need
                   to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation
                   and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous
                   occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes
                   mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To
                   facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a
                   Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open
                   reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope
                   and expressed from its natural chromosomal location.
                   Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a
                   census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth
                   and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that
                   about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal
                   growth conditions, and, using additional sequence
                   information, we systematically identify misannotated
                   genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than
                   50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these
                   molecules, including essential proteins and most
                   transcription factors, are present at levels that are
                   not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques

                   substantial fraction of these variants can influence
                   organismal phenotype, and some variants have fitness

                   are presented as an ideal model system of molecular
                   evolution where genotype, phenotype, and fitness can be
                   explicitly and independently characterized. In this
                   theoretical study, we construct an explicit model for
                   the evolution of regulatory sequences, making use of
                   the known biophysics of the binding of regulatory
                   proteins to DNA sequences, under the assumption that
                   fitness of a sequence depends only on its binding
                   affinity to the regulatory protein. The model is
                   confined to the mean field (i.e., infinite population
                   size) limit. Using realistic values for all parameters,
                   we determine the minimum fitness advantage needed to
                   maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly
                   the "error threshold" below which a binding sequence
                   cannot survive the accumulated effect of mutation over
                   long time. The commonly observed "fuzziness" in binding
                   motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance
                   between selection and mutation in our model. In
                   addition, we devise a simple model for the evolution of
                   multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory
                   region. We find the number of evolutionarily stable
                   binding sequences to increase in a step-like fashion
                   with increasing fitness advantage, if multiple
                   regulatory proteins can synergistically enhance gene
                   transcription. We discuss possible experimental
                   approaches to resolve open questions raised by our
                   study.},

                   acts on the site sequence via its binding affinity to

                   verify this form of selection and show that typical

  abstract       = {We present a statistical-mechanical selection theory
                   for the sequence analysis of a set of specific DNA
                   regulatory sites that makes it possible to predict the
                   relationship between individual base-pair choices in
                   the site and specific activity (affinity). The theory
                   is based on the assumption that specific DNA sequences
                   have been selected to conform to some requirement for
                   protein binding (or activity), and that all sequences
                   that can fulfil this requirement are equally likely to
                   occur. In most cases, the number of specific DNA
                   sequences that are known for a certain DNA-binding
                   protein is very small, and we discuss in detail the
                   small-sample uncertainties that this leads to. When
                   applied to the binding sites for cro repressor in phage
                   lambda, the theory can predict, from the sequence
                   statistics alone, their rank order binding affinities
                   in reasonable agreement with measured values. However,
                   the statistical uncertainty generated by such a small
                   sample (only 6 sites known) limits the result to
                   order-of-magnitude comparisons. When applied to the
                   much larger sample of Escherichia coli promoter
                   sequences, the theory predicts the correlation between
                   in vitro activity (k2KB values) and homology score
                   (closeness to the consensus sequence) observed by
                   Mulligan et al. (1984). The analysis of base-pair
                   frequencies in the promoter sample is consistent with
                   the assumption that base-pairs at different positions
                   in the sites contribute independently to the specific
                   activity, except in a few marginal cases that are
                   discussed. When the promoter sites are ordered
                   according to predicted activities, they seem to conform
                   to the Gaussian distribution that results from a
                   requirement for maximal sequence variability within the
                   constraint of providing a certain average activity. The
                   theory allows us to compare the number of specific
                   sites with a certain activity to the number that would
                   be expected from random occurrence in the genome. While
                   strong promoters are "overspecified", in the sense that
                   their probability of random occurrence is very low,
                   random sequences with weak promoter-like properties are
                   expected to occur in very large numbers. This leads to
                   the conclusion that functional specificity is based on
                   other properties in addition to primary sequence
                   recognition; some possibilities are discussed. Finally,
                   we show that the sequence information, as defined by
                   Schneider et al. (1986), can be used directly (at least
                   in the case of equilibrium binding sites) to estimate
                   the number of protein molecules that are specifically
                   bound at random "pseudosites" in the genome.(ABSTRACT

  abstract       = {The path by which regulatory sequence can change, yet
                   preserve function, is an important open question for
                   both evolution and bioinformatics. The recent
                   sequencing of two additional species of Drosophila plus
                   the wealth of data on gene regulation in the fruit fly
                   provides new means for addressing this question. For
                   regulatory sequences, indels account for more base
                   pairs (bp) of change than substitutions (between
                   Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba), though
                   they are fewer in number. Using Drosophila
                   pseudoobscura as an out-group, we can distinguish
                   insertions from deletions (with maximum parsimony
                   criteria), and find a ratio between 1 and 5 (insertions
                   to deletions) that is species dependent and much larger
                   than the ratio of 1/8 for neutral sequences (Petrov and
                   Hartl 1998). Because neutral sequence is rapidly
                   cleared from the genome, most noncoding regions which
                   preserve their length between D. melanogaster-D.
                   pseudoobscura and have an excess of insertions over
                   deletions should be functional. A fraction of 15\%-18\%
                   (i.e., more than 20 standard deviations from random
                   expectation) of the regulatory sequence is covered by
                   low copy number tandem repeats whose repeating unit has
                   an average length of 5-10 bp and which occur
                   preferentially (25\%-45\% coverage) in indels. All
                   indels may be due to tandem repeats if we extrapolate
                   the detection efficiency of the repeat-finding
                   algorithms using the observed point mutation rate
                   between the species we compare. Sequence creation by
                   local duplication accords with the tendency for
                   multiple copies of transcription factor-binding sites
                   to occur in regulatory modules. Thus, indel events and
                   tandem repeats in particular need to be incorporated
                   into models of regulatory evolution because they can
                   alter the rate at which beneficial variants arise and
                   should also influence bioinformatic algorithms that
                   parse regulatory sequences into binding sites.},

                   in rapidly growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. mRNAs were
                   separated by velocity sedimentation on a sucrose
                   gradient, and 14 fractions across the gradient were
                   analyzed by quantitative microarray analysis, providing
                   a profile of ribosome association with mRNAs for
                   thousands of genes. For most genes, the majority of
                   mRNA molecules were associated with ribosomes and
                   presumably engaged in translation. This systematic
                   approach enabled us to recognize genes with unusual
                   behavior. For 43 genes, most mRNA molecules were not
                   associated with ribosomes, suggesting that they may be
                   translationally controlled. For 53 genes, including
                   GCN4, CPA1, and ICY2, three genes for which
                   translational control is known to play a key role in
                   regulation, most mRNA molecules were associated with a
                   single ribosome. The number of ribosomes associated
                   with mRNAs increased with increasing length of the
                   putative protein-coding sequence, consistent with
                   longer transit times for ribosomes translating longer
                   coding sequences. The density at which ribosomes were
                   distributed on each mRNA (i.e., the number of ribosomes
                   per unit ORF length) was well below the maximum packing
                   density for nearly all mRNAs, consistent with
                   initiation as the rate-limiting step in translation.
                   Global analysis revealed an unexpected correlation:
                   Ribosome density decreases with increasing ORF length.
                   Models to account for this surprising observation are
                   discussed.},

                   regulation network are at the root of much of the
                   phenotypic variation observed among organisms. These
                   differences may be achieved either by changing the
                   repertoire of regulators and/or their targets, or by
                   rewiring the network. Following these changes and
                   studying their logic is crucial for understanding the
                   evolution of regulatory networks. RESULTS: We use the
                   well characterized transcription regulatory network of
                   Escherichia coli K12 and follow the evolutionary
                   changes in the repertoire of regulators and their
                   targets across a large number of fully sequenced
                   gamma-proteobacteria. By focusing on close relatives of
                   E. coli K12, we study the dynamics of the evolution of
                   transcription regulation across a relatively short
                   evolutionary timescale. We show significant differences
                   in the evolution of repressors and activators.
                   Repressors are only lost from a genome once their
                   targets have themselves been lost, or once the network
                   has significantly rewired. In contrast, activators are
                   often lost even when their targets remain in the
                   genome. As a result, E. coli K12 repressors that
                   regulate many targets are rarely absent from organisms
                   that are closely related to E. coli K12, while
                   activators with a similar number of targets are often
                   absent in these organisms. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate
                   that the mode of regulation exerted by transcription
                   factors has a strong effect on their evolution.
                   Repressors co-evolve tightly with their target genes.
                   In contrast, activators can be lost independently of
                   their targets. In fact, loss of an activator can lead
                   to efficient shutdown of an unnecessary pathway.},

                   key role in regulatory networks. Comparative studies
                   show that modules of coexpressed genes are conserved
                   across taxa. However, little is known about the
                   mechanisms underlying the evolution of module
                   regulation. Here, we explore the evolution of
                   cis-regulatory programs associated with conserved
                   modules by integrating expression profiles for two
                   yeast species and sequence data for a total of 17
                   fungal genomes. We show that although the cis-elements
                   accompanying certain conserved modules are strictly
                   conserved, those of other conserved modules are
                   remarkably diverged. In particular, we infer the
                   evolutionary history of the regulatory program
                   governing ribosomal modules. We show how a cis-element
                   emerged concurrently in dozens of promoters of
                   ribosomal protein genes, followed by the loss of a more
                   ancient cis-element. We suggest that this formation of
                   an intermediate redundant regulatory program allows
                   conserved transcriptional modules to gradually switch
                   from one regulatory mechanism to another while
                   maintaining their functionality. Our work provides a
                   general framework for the study of the dynamics of
                   promoter evolution at the level of transcriptional
                   modules and may help in understanding the evolvability
                   and increased redundancy of transcriptional regulation

                   investigate this, we systematically explored the
                   conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by
                   examining the cis-regulatory elements that govern the
                   expression of coregulated genes. We first identified
                   groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes
                   enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream
                   cis-regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of these
                   gene groups are coregulated in related species as well,
                   we performed similar analyses on orthologs of
                   coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other ascomycete
                   species. We find that many species-specific gene groups
                   are enriched for the same flanking regulatory sequences

                   addition to these clear cases of regulatory
                   conservation, we find examples of cis-element evolution

                   factor-binding specificity, incorporation of new gene
                   targets into an existing regulatory system, and
                   cooption of regulatory systems to control a different

                   of such intergenomic comparisons for promoter
                   annotation is expanding. The efficacy of such
                   comparisons for the identification of functional
                   regulatory elements hinges on the evolutionary dynamics
                   of promoter sequences. Although it is widely
                   appreciated that conservation of sequence motifs may
                   provide a suggestion of function, it is not known as to
                   what proportion of the functional binding sites in
                   humans is conserved in distant species. In this report,
                   we present an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of
                   transcription factor binding sites whose function had
                   been experimentally verified in promoters of 51 human
                   genes and compare their sequence to homologous
                   sequences in other primate species and rodents. Our
                   results show that there is extensive divergence within
                   the nucleotide sequence of transcription factor binding
                   sites. Using direct experimental data from functional
                   studies in both human and rodents for 20 of the

  abstract       = {The evolution of new functions takes place partially
                   through changes in the way transcription is controlled.
                   Transcriptional control is brought about by the
                   interactions of transcription factors with short target
                   motifs in the DNAs of promoters and enhancers. One way
                   in which changes in gene expression can evolve is
                   through the acquisition of new transcription factor
                   targets in enhancer sequences. Since such target sites
                   are simple, they can be produced rapidly from random
                   DNA by mutation and selection. Here we consider a
                   population of organisms that finds itself in an
                   ecological situation where bringing a particular target
                   gene under the control of a particular transcription
                   factor would be favored by natural selection. What will
                   be the time required for such a process, as a function
                   of the selection for the new target, the mutation rate,
                   and the population size? The starting sequences
                   considered are either real enhancers from the
                   Drosophila melanogaster genome, or randomized versions
                   of these. We find that the time required to find
                   binding sites is strongly dependent on the existence in
                   the starting sequence of sites that differ from binding
                   sites by single substitutions (presites). The process
                   of converting presites to binding sites is driven by
                   natural selection, and thus the time required typically
                   reduces with the strength of selection. However, if
                   there is a strongly distorted G:C ratio in the starting
                   sequence, presites will typically be absent, and the
                   finding of binding sites will be preceded by a long
                   time period of neutral evolution, however strong is the
                   selection favoring sites. The positions of presites
                   largely determine where binding sites will evolve. One
                   result of this is that any incremental selective
                   benefits that result from the relative positioning of
                   sites have a surprisingly small impact on the final
                   binding-site positions.},

                   evidence suggests that transcription factor binding
                   sites can undergo divergence and turnover even when the
                   transcriptional output remains conserved. Furthermore,
                   it is likely that there exist lineage specific
                   differences in the retention rate of binding sites that
                   make it desirable to estimate the rate of acquisition
                   and decay of transcription factor binding sites from
                   comparative sequence data. In this paper we propose a
                   stochastic, phenomenological model for binding site
                   turnover. For a given genomic region we assume a
                   constant rate of binding site origination lambda and a
                   constant per site decay rate of mu. We derived an
                   explicit expression for the conditional probability
                   distribution of the number of binding sites n at time t
                   given n(0) binding sites at t=0. The analytical result
                   was compared to a simulation model and we found that it
                   closely predicts the simulated sequence evolution. We
                   then analyzed a small data set of the number of
                   estrogen response elements (ERE) in mammalian HoxA
                   sequences and showed that the data is broadly
                   consistent with the assumption of a stationary turnover
                   process. A regression of shared EREs over the time
                   since divergence led to an estimate of the half-life
                   time for an ERE in the primate HoxA clusters of about
                   27 Myr, which corresponds to a per site decay rate of
                   mu approximately 1.3 x 10(-8)/year and a rate of
                   origination of lambda approximately 1.6 x 10(-7)/year.
                   We conclude that the model can be used to estimate the
                   rate of binding site turnover from comparative genomic
                   data.},

                   regulation is crucial for understanding the molecular
                   basis of both phenotypic diversity and evolution. By
                   means of chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA
                   microarray analysis, the divergence in the binding
                   sites of the pseudohyphal regulators Ste12 and Tec1 was
                   determined in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S.
                   mikatae, and S. bayanus under pseudohyphal conditions.
                   We have shown that most of these sites have diverged
                   across these species, far exceeding the interspecies
                   variation in orthologous genes. A group of Ste12
                   targets was shown to be bound only in S. mikatae and S.
                   bayanus under pseudohyphal conditions. Many of these
                   genes are targets of Ste12 during mating in S.
                   cerevisiae, indicating that specialization between the
                   two pathways has occurred in this species.
                   Transcription factor binding sites have therefore
                   diverged substantially faster than ortholog content.
                   Thus, gene regulation resulting from transcription
                   factor binding is likely to be a major cause of
                   divergence between related species.},

                   interactions are highly polymorphic, and regulatory
                   interactions have been gained and lost within human
                   populations. On average, humans are heterozygous at
                   more functional cis-regulatory sites (>16,000) than at
                   amino acid positions (<13,000), in part because of an
                   overrepresentation among the former in multiallelic
                   tandem repeat variation, especially (AC)(n)
                   dinucleotide microsatellites. The role of
                   microsatellites in gene expression variation may
                   provide a larger store of heritable phenotypic
                   variation, and a more rapid mutational input of such
                   variation, than has been realized. Finally, we outline
                   the distinctive consequences of cis-regulatory
                   variation for the genotype-phenotype relationship,
                   including ubiquitous epistasis and
                   genotype-by-environment interactions, as well as
                   underappreciated modes of pleiotropy and overdominance.
                   Ordinary small-scale mutations contribute to pervasive
                   variation in transcription rates and consequently to
                   patterns of human phenotypic variation.},

                   knowledge of the rates of protein production and
                   destruction within cells. Using an epitope-tagged
                   strain collection, we measured the half-life of >3,750
                   proteins in the yeast proteome after inhibition of
                   translation. By integrating our data with previous
                   measurements of protein and mRNA abundance and
                   translation rate, we provide evidence that many
                   proteins partition into one of two regimes for protein
                   metabolism: one optimized for efficient production or a
                   second optimized for regulatory efficiency.
                   Incorporation of protein half-life information into a
                   simple quantitative model for protein production
                   improves our ability to predict steady-state protein
                   abundance values. Analysis of a simple dynamic protein
                   production model reveals a remarkable correlation
                   between transcriptional regulation and protein
                   half-life within some groups of coregulated genes,
                   suggesting that cells coordinate these two processes to
                   achieve uniform effects on protein abundances. Our

                   evolution, little is know about their evolutionary

                   evolution of binding sites for transcription factors
                   using as a model a well characterized system, the
                   Drosophila early developmental enhancers. We compare
                   the sequences of eight enhancer regions for early
                   developmental genes between Drosophila melanogaster and
                   other two species, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila
                   pseudoobscura, searching for the presence/absence of
                   104 biochemically verified binding sites from D.
                   melanogaster. We also modeled the binding specificity
                   of each binding site by the use of well-defined
                   positional weight matrices (PWMs). The comparisons
                   showed that turnover of binding sites seems to fit a
                   molecular clock, at an approximate rate of 0.94\% of
                   gain/loss of binding sites per million years. This
                   intense turnover affects both high and low affinity
                   binding sites at the same extent. Furthermore, the
                   subset of overlapping binding sites is also subjected
                   to this high turnover. Conserved binding sites seem to
                   be constrained to maintain not only location but also
                   the exact sequence at each particular position.
                   Finally, we detected a significant decrease in mean PWM
                   scores for the D. virilis binding sites in the case of
                   Hunchback. Possible explanations for this fact are

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: The regulation of a gene depends on the
                   binding of transcription factors to specific sites
                   located in the regulatory region of the gene. The
                   generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity
                   between them are essential building blocks in the
                   evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a
                   theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding
                   sites by point mutations. The approach is based on
                   biophysical models for the binding of transcription
                   factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded
                   fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics
                   model including mutations, genetic drift, and
                   selection. RESULTS: We show that the selection for
                   factor binding generically leads to specific
                   correlations between nucleotide frequencies at
                   different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate
                   the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating
                   a new binding site for a given transcription factor by
                   point mutations. The evolutionary time required is
                   estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation
                   rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective
                   population size. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of binding
                   site formation is seen to depend on two joint
                   conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough
                   and the promoter region must be long enough. These
                   constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in
                   eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the
                   adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal
                   integration through binding cooperativity between
                   different sites. Experimental tests of this picture
                   involving the statistics of polymorphisms and
                   phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

                   binding sites has been proposed as a major source of
                   evolutionary change in cis-regulatory DNA and gene
                   expression. We have developed an evolutionary model to
                   study binding-site turnover that uses multiple sequence
                   alignments to assess the evolutionary constraint on
                   individual binding sites, and to map gain and loss
                   events along a phylogenetic tree. We apply this model
                   to study the evolutionary dynamics of binding sites of
                   the Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Zeste,
                   using genome-wide in vivo (ChIP-chip) binding data to
                   identify functional Zeste binding sites, and the genome
                   sequences of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta,
                   and D. yakuba to study their evolution. We estimate
                   that more than 5\% of functional Zeste binding sites in
                   D. melanogaster were gained along the D. melanogaster
                   lineage or lost along one of the other lineages. We
                   find that Zeste-bound regions have a reduced rate of
                   binding-site loss and an increased rate of binding-site
                   gain relative to flanking sequences. Finally, we show
                   that binding-site gains and losses are asymmetrically
                   distributed with respect to D. melanogaster, consistent
                   with lineage-specific acquisition and loss of
                   Zeste-responsive regulatory elements.},

  abstract       = {Cis-regulatory sequences are not always conserved
                   across species. Divergence within cis-regulatory
                   sequences may result from the evolution of
                   species-specific patterns of gene expression or the
                   flexible nature of the cis-regulatory code. The
                   identification of functional divergence in
                   cis-regulatory sequences is therefore important for
                   both understanding the role of gene regulation in
                   evolution and annotating regulatory elements. We have
                   developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss of
                   constraint on individual transcription factor binding
                   sites (TFBSs). We find that a significant fraction of
                   functionally constrained binding sites have been lost
                   in a lineage-specific manner among three closely
                   related yeast species. Binding site loss has previously
                   been explained by turnover, where the concurrent gain
                   and loss of a binding site maintains gene regulation.
                   We estimate that nearly half of all loss events cannot
                   be explained by binding site turnover. Recreating the
                   mutations that led to binding site loss confirms that
                   these sequence changes affect gene expression in some
                   cases. We also estimate that there is a high rate of
                   binding site gain, as more than half of experimentally
                   identified S. cerevisiae binding sites are not
                   conserved across species. The frequent gain and loss of
                   TFBSs implies that cis-regulatory sequences are labile
                   and, in the absence of turnover, may contribute to
                   species-specific patterns of gene expression.},

                   conserved and diverged sequences and to infer their
                   function. While such studies enabled the detection of
                   conserved sequences in large genomes, the evolutionary
                   dynamics of regulatory regions as a whole remain poorly
                   understood. Here we present a probabilistic model for
                   the evolution of promoter regions in yeast, combining
                   the effects of regulatory interactions of many
                   different transcription factors. The model expresses
                   explicitly the selection forces acting on transcription
                   factor binding sites in the context of a dynamic
                   evolutionary process. We develop algorithms to compute
                   likelihood and to learn de novo collections of
                   transcription factor binding motifs and their selection
                   parameters from alignments. Using the new techniques,
                   we examine the evolutionary dynamics in Saccharomyces
                   species promoters. Analyses of an evolutionary model
                   constructed using all known transcription factor
                   binding motifs and of a model learned from the data
                   automatically reveal relatively weak selection on most
                   binding sites. Moreover, according to our estimates,
                   strong binding sites are constraining only a fraction
                   of the yeast promoter sequence that is under selection.
                   Our study demonstrates how complex evolutionary
                   dynamics in noncoding regions emerges from
                   formalization of the evolutionary consequences of known
