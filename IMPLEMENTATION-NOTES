ChangeSCyto       change_mRNA_cytoplasm

Defines
-------

NPROTEINS total number of proteins (normally equal to NGENES)
TFGENES   total number of transcription factors (TFs)
NGENES    total number of cisreg genes
          including genes for encoding TFs and metabolic genes under selection
          usually this equal to TFGENES + 1, however, if the library is used in 
          standalone manner, e.g. tfonly, NGENES=1 and TFGENES could be larger

When used in the whole cell model, NPROTEINS = TFGENES + 1 = NGENES
however, in general, there could be proteins (e.g. from outside the
cell) that aren't controlled by the NGENES cisreg genes.  The current
code doesn't officially support that yet, however, but the groundwork
is being laid by splitting out TFGENES from NPROTEINS.
